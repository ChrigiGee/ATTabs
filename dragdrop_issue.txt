was issue:
linux: onmouseup - onmousemove don't happen if mouse out of control.
this causes impossible to drop tabs to other attabs. even cursor don't change to "drop allow".
made change: timer which checks IsMousePressed and does drop-
- internal drop (inside one attabs) done on onmouseup;
- external drop (to other attabs) done in ontimer.

maybe race exists (between onmouseup/ontimer)? do check on Win. do check on D7.
